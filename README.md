A simple code for converting fahrenheit value to celsius in c++, while enabling user to input fahrenheit value in the console
In this program, we first declare two variables fahrenheit and celsius to store the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius, respectively. We then prompt the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit and read the input using the cin function.

The conversion formula to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is (F - 32) * 5/9, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit. We use this formula to convert the temperature and store it in the celsius variable.

Finally, we print the temperature in Celsius using the cout function. The endl is used to add a new line after the output.

When you run this program and enter a temperature in Fahrenheit, it will convert the temperature to Celsius and print the result.
